            {
              "q": "What is copy trading?",
              "a": "Copy trading allows you to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders or AI strategies in your own account. When the strategy trades, your account mirrors those actions proportionally."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do I need trading experience to copy trade?",
              "a": "No. Copy trading is designed for beginners. You don’t place trades manually—your role is to choose a strategy, manage risk settings, and monitor performance."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I lose money with copy trading?",
              "a": "Yes. All trading involves risk. Copy trading reduces the need for decision-making, but it does not remove market risk. This is why risk controls and drawdown limits are important."
            },
            {
              "q": "What markets are typically traded?",
              "a": "Within Pandora AI, strategies focus on liquid markets such as Forex and Gold, which are widely traded and commonly used in automated systems."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is drawdown and why does it matter?",
              "a": "Drawdown refers to how much an account can decline from its highest value. Pandora AI strategies are designed with a predefined maximum drawdown of 10% to help manage downside risk, and all strategies are configured to manage stoploss within these parameters"
            },
            {
              "q": "What is an amplified or instant funded account?",
              "a": "An amplified (instant funded) account multiplies your trading exposure relative to your deposit. For example, with Pandora AI and Axis a 10x amplified account means your capital is increased tenfold for trading purposes—while risk limits remain clearly defined."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I stop copy trading at any time?",
              "a": "Yes. You can pause or disconnect from a strategy whenever you choose, subject to broker platform rules."
            },
            {
              "q": "How are lot fees calculated?",
              "a": "Lot fees aren’t a single fee — they’re the sum of spread, commission, and swap, scaled by lot size. Within the Pandora AI project these lot fees are distributed between the broker and the IB Structure (Affiliate Network) in accordance to the reward plan.

              "q": "How are Performance fees calculated with regards to High Water Mark?",
              "a": "A high watermark (HWM) performance fee is a mechanism ensuring performance fees are only charged on new profits, not on recovery of previous losses. It sets the highest previous value (peak) the account has reached; if the value drops, the account must surpass this previous peak before performance fees are charged again.",

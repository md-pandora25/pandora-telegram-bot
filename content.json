            {
              "q": "What is copy trading?",
              "a": "Copy trading allows you to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders or AI strategies in your own account. When the strategy trades, your account mirrors those actions proportionally."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do I need trading experience to copy trade?",
              "a": "No. Copy trading is designed for beginners. You don’t place trades manually—your role is to choose a strategy, manage risk settings, and monitor performance."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I lose money with copy trading?",
              "a": "Yes. All trading involves risk. Copy trading reduces the need for decision-making, but it does not remove market risk. This is why risk controls and drawdown limits are important."
            },
            {
              "q": "What markets are typically traded?",
              "a": "Within Pandora AI, strategies focus on liquid markets such as Forex and Gold, which are widely traded and commonly used in automated systems."
            },
            {
              "q": "What is drawdown and why does it matter?",
              "a": "Drawdown refers to how much an account can decline from its highest value. Pandora AI strategies are designed with a predefined maximum drawdown of 10% to help manage downside risk, and all strategies are configured to manage stoploss within these parameters"
            },
            {
              "q": "What is an amplified or instant funded account?",
              "a": "An amplified (instant funded) account multiplies your trading exposure relative to your deposit. For example, with Pandora AI and Axis a 10x amplified account means your capital is increased tenfold for trading purposes—while risk limits remain clearly defined."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I stop copy trading at any time?",
              "a": "Yes. You can pause or disconnect from a strategy whenever you choose, subject to broker platform rules."
            },
            {
              "q": "How are lot fees calculated?",
              "a": "Lot fees aren’t a single fee — they’re the sum of spread, commission, and swap, scaled by lot size. Within the Pandora AI project these lot fees are distributed between the broker and the IB Structure (Affiliate Network) in accordance to the reward plan.

            {
              "q": "How are Performance fees calculated with regards to High Water Mark?",
              "a": "A high watermark (HWM) performance fee is a mechanism ensuring performance fees are only charged on new profits, not on recovery of previous losses. It sets the highest previous value (peak) the account has reached; if the value drops, the account must surpass this previous peak before performance fees are charged again.",

              "a": "A 10% drawdown is the difference between your account’s highest balance and its current balance, expressed as a percentage. In forex trading, a 10% drawdown means your trading account has lost 10% of its value from a peak."

              "q": "Can Pandora AI access my money?",

              "q": "How long do withdrawals take?",

            {
              "q": "Was ist Copytrading?",
              "a": "Copytrading ermöglicht es dir, Trades von erfahrenen Tradern oder KI-Strategien automatisch in deinem eigenen Konto zu spiegeln. Wenn die Strategie handelt, werden diese Aktionen proportional in deinem Konto nachgebildet."
            },
            {
              "q": "Brauche ich Trading-Erfahrung, um Copytrading zu nutzen?",
              "a": "Nein. Copytrading ist für Einsteiger gedacht. Du platzierst keine Trades manuell – deine Aufgabe ist es, eine Strategie auszuwählen, Risiko-Einstellungen zu verwalten und die Performance zu überwachen."
            },
            {
              "q": "Kann ich mit Copytrading Geld verlieren?",
              "a": "Ja. Jeder Handel ist mit Risiko verbunden. Copytrading reduziert zwar die Notwendigkeit eigener Entscheidungen, nimmt dir aber das Marktrisiko nicht ab. Deshalb sind Risikokontrollen und Drawdown-Limits wichtig."
            },
            {
              "q": "Welche Märkte werden typischerweise gehandelt?",
              "a": "Innerhalb von Pandora AI fokussieren sich Strategien auf liquide Märkte wie Forex und Gold – diese werden stark gehandelt und sind in automatisierten Systemen üblich."
            },
            {
              "q": "Was ist ein Drawdown und warum ist er wichtig?",
              "a": "Der Drawdown beschreibt, wie stark ein Konto vom höchsten Stand (Peak) aus fallen kann. Pandora-AI-Strategien sind mit einem vordefinierten maximalen Drawdown von 10% ausgelegt, um das Abwärtsrisiko zu steuern, und alle Strategien sind so konfiguriert, dass sie Stop-Loss innerhalb dieser Parameter managen."
            },
            {
              "q": "Was ist ein amplifiziertes bzw. Instant-Funded-Konto?",
              "a": "Ein amplifiziertes (Instant-Funded) Konto erhöht deine Trading-Exponierung im Verhältnis zu deiner Einzahlung. Zum Beispiel bedeutet bei Pandora AI und Axis ein 10x amplifiziertes Konto, dass dein Kapital für Trading-Zwecke verzehnfacht wird – während die Risikolimits weiterhin klar definiert bleiben."

            {
              "q": "Kann ich Copytrading jederzeit stoppen?",
              "a": "Ja. Du kannst eine Strategie jederzeit pausieren oder trennen – vorbehaltlich der Regeln der Broker-Plattform."
            },
            {
              "q": "Wie werden Lot-Gebühren berechnet?",
              "a": "Lot-Gebühren sind keine einzelne Gebühr – sie sind die Summe aus Spread, Kommission und Swap, skaliert nach Lot-Größe. Innerhalb des Pandora-AI-Projekts werden diese Lot-Gebühren gemäß Reward-Plan zwischen dem Broker und der IB-Struktur (Affiliate-Netzwerk) verteilt.

            {
              "q": "Wie werden Performance Fees in Bezug auf den High Water Mark berechnet?",
              "a": "Eine High-Watermark-(HWM)-Performance Fee stellt sicher, dass Performance Fees nur auf neue Gewinne berechnet werden – nicht auf die Aufholung früherer Verluste. Dabei wird der höchste bisher erreichte Kontowert (Peak) festgelegt; fällt der Wert, muss das Konto diesen früheren Höchststand erst wieder übersteigen, bevor erneut Performance Fees berechnet werden.",

              "q": "Wie erklärt ihr genau, was 10% Drawdown bedeutet?",
              "a": "Ein 10%-Drawdown ist die Differenz zwischen dem höchsten Kontostand und dem aktuellen Kontostand, ausgedrückt als Prozentsatz. Im Forex-Trading bedeutet ein 10%-Drawdown, dass dein Trading-Konto vom Peak aus 10% an Wert verloren hat."
            },

              "q": "Kann ich mein Konto aufladen, auch wenn gerade Trades offen sind?",
              "a": "JA. Du kannst dein Trading-Konto jederzeit aufladen. Du musst nur die Kontonummer kennen, die du aufladen möchtest, und den Betrag, den du einzahlen willst. Dann besuche einfach den Link unten.",

            {
              "q": "Schicke ich Geld an Pandora AI?",

            {
              "q": "Kann Pandora AI auf mein Geld zugreifen?",
              "a": "Nein. Pandora-Strategien können auf deinem Konto nur über freigegebene Systeme (z. B. Copytrading-Setups) handeln. Auszahlungen bleiben immer unter deiner Kontrolle."

            {
              "q": "Wie lange dauern Auszahlungen?",
              "a": "Die Geschäftsbedingungen besagen, dass eine Auszahlung zwischen 1 und 5 Tagen dauern kann. Auszahlungen über Krypto sind in der Regel schneller als über traditionelle Finanzwege."

Es gibt auch keine Teilzahlung – du stellst eine Anfrage und deine gesamten ausstehenden Provisionen werden vollständig ausgezahlt.\n\nTRADING-GEWINNE - JA.

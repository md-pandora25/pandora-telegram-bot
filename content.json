              "q": "What is copy trading?",
              "a": "Copy trading allows you to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders or AI strategies in your own account. When the strategy trades, your account mirrors those actions proportionally."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do I need trading experience to copy trade?",

            {
              "q": "Can I lose money with copy trading?",
              "a": "Yes. All trading involves risk. Copy trading reduces the need for decision-making, but it does not remove market risk. This is why risk controls and drawdown limits are important."

              "q": "What markets are typically traded?",

            {
              "q": "What is drawdown and why does it matter?",
              "a": "Drawdown refers to how much an account can decline from its highest value. Pandora AI strategies are designed with a predefined maximum drawdown of 10% to help manage downside risk, and all strategies are configured to manage stoploss within these parameters"
            },
            {
              "q": "What is an amplified or instant funded account?",
              "a": "An amplified (instant funded) account multiplies your trading exposure relative to your deposit. For example, with Pandora AI and Axis a 10x amplified account means your capital is increased tenfold for trading purposes—while risk limits remain clearly defined."
            },
            {

              "a": "Lot fees aren’t a single fee — they’re the sum of spread, commission, and swap, scaled by lot size. Within the Pandora AI project these lot fees are distributed between the broker and the IB Structure (Affiliate Network) in accordance to the reward plan.

              "a": "A high watermark (HWM) performance fee is a mechanism ensuring performance fees are only charged on new profits, not on recovery of previous losses. It sets the highest previous value (peak) the account has reached; if the value drops, the account must surpass this previous peak before performance fees are charged again.",

              "q": "How long do withdrawals take?",

Axis endeavours to keep this under 24 hours, however this is not always possible depending on the time of day the request is made, or if the request is placed on a weekend, it may not be processed until the Monday. Equally, withdrawals via crypto tend to be much faster than traditional finance routes."

Pandora-AI-Strategien sind mit einem vordefinierten maximalen Drawdown von 10% ausgelegt, um das Abwärtsrisiko zu steuern, und alle Strategien sind so konfiguriert, dass sie Stop-Loss innerhalb dieser Parameter managen."

Axis bemüht sich, dies unter 24 Stunden zu halten, jedoch ist dies nicht immer möglich, je nach Tageszeit der Anfrage oder wenn die Anfrage am Wochenende gestellt wird – sie wird möglicherweise erst am Montag bearbeitet. Ebenso sind Auszahlungen über Krypto in der Regel deutlich schneller als über traditionelle Finanzwege."

Es gibt auch keine Teilzahlung – du stellst eine Anfrage und deine gesamten ausstehenden Provisionen werden vollständig ausgezahlt.\n\nTRADING-GEWINNE - JA. Es muss mindestens 50 $ in deinem verfügbaren Eigenkapital vorhanden sein, um eine Auszahlung anzufordern."

      "questions": [
        {
          "q": "What is copy trading?",
          "a": "Copy trading allows you to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders or AI strategies in your own account. When the strategy trades, your account mirrors those actions proportionally."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do I need trading experience to copy trade?",
          "a": "No. Copy trading is designed for beginners. You don’t place trades manually—your role is to choose a strategy, manage risk settings, and monitor performance."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I lose money with copy trading?",
          "a": "Yes. All trading involves risk. Copy trading reduces the need for decision-making, but it does not remove market risk."
        },
        {
          "q": "How are lot fees calculated?",
          "a": "Lot fees aren’t a single fee — they’re the sum of spread, commission, and swap, scaled by lot size. Within the Pandora AI project, these lot fees are distributed between the broker and the IB (Affiliate) structure in accordance with the reward plan. If you have not yet seen these details, please view the presentations below.",

        {
          "q": "How are Performance fees calculated with regards to High Water Mark?",
          "a": "A high watermark (HWM) performance fee ensures performance fees are only charged on new profits, not on the recovery of previous losses. If an account experiences a drawdown, it must exceed its previous highest balance before any further performance fees are applied.",

        },
        {
          "q": "How do you explain exactly what 10% draw down means?",
          "a": "A 10% drawdown is the difference between your account’s highest balance and its current balance, expressed as a percentage. In trading, this means the account has declined by 10% from its previous peak."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I top up my account even if there are current live trades?",
          "a": "YES. You can top up your trading account at any time. All you need is the account number you wish to top up and the amount you want to deposit. You can then complete the process using the link below.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What is copy trading?",
      "a": "Copy trading allows you to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders or AI strategies in your own account. When the strategy trades, your account mirrors those actions proportionally."
    },
{
      "q": "Do I need trading experience to copy trade?",
      "a": "No. Copy trading is designed for beginners. You don’t place trades manually—your role is to choose a strategy, manage risk settings, and monitor performance."
    },
{
      "q": "Can I lose money with copy trading?",
      "a": "Yes. All trading involves risk. Copy trading reduces the need for decision-making, but it does not remove market risk. This is why risk controls and drawdown limits are important."
    },
{
      "q": "What markets are typically traded?",
      "a": "Within Pandora AI, strategies focus on liquid markets such as Forex and Gold, which are widely traded and commonly used in automated systems."
    },
{
      "q": "What is drawdown and why does it matter?",
      "a": "Drawdown refers to how much an account can decline from its highest value. Pandora AI strategies are designed with a predefined maximum drawdown of 10% to help manage downside risk, and all strategies are configured to manage stoploss within these parameters"
    },
{
      "q": "What is an amplified or instant funded account?",
      "a": "An amplified (instant funded) account multiplies your trading exposure relative to your deposit. For example, a 10x amplified account means your capital is increased tenfold for trading purposes—while risk limits remain clearly defined."
    },
{
      "q": "Why does using a regulated broker matter?",
      "a": "A regulated broker like Axis Capital Group operates under financial oversight, must meet compliance standards, and follows rules around client fund handling, reporting, and transparency."
    },
{
      "q": "Do I send money to Pandora AI?",
      "a": "No. Funds are held in your own broker account. Pandora provides strategies and community access—it does not custody client funds."
    },
{
      "q": "Can Pandora AI access my money?",
      "a": "No. Pandora strategies can trade on your account only via permissioned systems (such as copy trading setups). Withdrawals always remain under your control."
    },
{
      "q": "Can I stop copy trading at any time?",
      "a": "Yes. You can pause or disconnect from a strategy whenever you choose, subject to broker platform rules."
    },
{
      "q": "Is Pandora AI an affiliate program?",
      "a": "Pandora AI has a structured referral and commission system, withing Axis Capital Groups, Sub IB environment. (IB = Introducing Broker, often compared to an affiliate in other industries)"
    },
{
      "q": "Do I need to recruit people to earn?",
      "a": "No. Many members participate purely as copy traders. Networking is optional and suited to those who enjoy community building and education."
    },

    },
{
      "q": "Is copy trading passive income?",
      "a": "It can be semi-passive, but not “set and forget.” You should still monitor performance, understand risk, and stay informed."
    },
{
      "q": "Are profits guaranteed?",
      "a": "No. There are no guaranteed returns. Any platform claiming guaranteed profits should be avoided."
